# squid-dice-game
A typical dice game with the squid game theme
You start the game by tapping on the roll button depending on the player whose turn it is.
Once the score of any of the player reaches 20, the reset button appears and once that is clicked, the games restarts and goes back to default.

HAPPY PLAYING!!!
